ON THE SIMPLICITY OF GREATNESS.</h2>


<p>Great men are always simple&mdash;strikingly so; simple in their
thoughts and feelings, and in the expression of them. Nor is this
an unimportant characteristic. For to one who reflects how few
artless men there are&mdash;how much there is that is factitious, in
the character of almost every one whom he meets; most of all,
in the character of those who ape this same simplicity; how much
many men consult fashion, custom, and mode for their thoughts
and feelings, instead of their own hearts and minds, till they
almost cease to have any of their own; and when it is not so, how
much rules of thinking and of feeling insensibly influence us;&mdash;to
such a one, true simplicity will appear worthy the name of a rare
virtue, and further, of an important one&mdash;especially, if he considers
how much even the smallest act of cunning or affectation impairs
the honesty and high-mindedness of him who allows it. As such,
we might express our admiration of it in the great man, and derive
from thence a strong recommendation.</p>

<p>But it may bring out more important results to ask why, especially
by what peculiar mental habits it is, that minds which might, with
the best reason, make a parade of their powers, are apparently so
utterly unconscious of them, and so thoroughly simple. A chief
reason is, that a great mind is completely absorbed in the objects before
it, to the entire forgetfulness of self. The objects must be great
certainly, thus to fill the mind; there must also be great powers to
grasp them. Both these things are supposed in the truly great man.
But the peculiar feature of his mind is this complete absorption in
the objects of contemplation. It is carried forth beyond the cares
and complexities of what most men call self, and for a time, at least,
identifies itself with its object. His own powers, as things of selfish
pride, are the last to concern his thoughts, and are only instruments
of bringing before him the truth. In this he approaches what may
be regarded as perfect mental action. For what are these powers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
but instruments? And what is the mind in itself apart from its objects?
Truths so plain seem to be forgotten by those who idolize
mental power in themselves and others, more than they revere the
truth, on which it is, or should be employed.</p>

<p>To this it may be added, that the great mind is generally absorbed
by single objects. The one truth which absorbed the mind of Newton,
was that of the law of universal gravitation. All the energies
of Bacon’s mind were active in the elucidation of the single truth,
that facts are at the foundation of reasoning. The same has been
true of those who have made plain great moral truths. Indeed the
end of every mind which acts to purpose is more or less definitely
the perception of unity. But many minds mistake the single truth
which explains the whole subject, or assuming that which is false,
or taking up minor relations, or seeking complication for the love of
it, go a-raving amid cycles and epicycles, extent of knowledge only
making the confusion greater.</p>

<p>You shall see men disquieting themselves in vain, and plunging
into hot and endless debate, all for the overlooking of some single
truth which puts an end to all question. It is this tendency towards
unity dimly seen in ordinary minds, which is brought out into a distinct
habit, in minds of a higher order, and gives them their peculiar
oneness and simplicity.</p>

<p>But we have not spoken of that which leads to this absorption of
the mind in its objects. It is the love of truth&mdash;of all truth. Not
that other minds have none of it, but it lies mixed, often insensibly,
with other desires which reflect upon self, or reach out towards some
foreign end, and thus mar its simplicity. There is the love of favor,
the ambition of rivaling some admired forerunner or competitor, the
desire of seeming superior to the vulgar crowd, the love of victory
in discussion. More laudable than these, there is the desire of success
in some pursuit or project, or a desire of acquiring what may be
useful. More nearly affecting the mind’s operations, there is the
love of novelty for novelty’s sake, the love of system, and the desire
of bringing forth to the world something new. Besides these
there are a thousand prejudiced feelings, aside from the simple love
of the truth, which influence men in forming their opinions and in
searching after truth. It is easy to see how all these differ in their
nature from love of truth for the truth’s sake, and, of course, when
blended with it destroy its simplicity. It is not a sense of duty even
which mainly influences the great mind in its pursuit of truth. The
love of it in such a mind is a passion, an appetite, which asks simply
the reception of its natural food; an appetite ever enlarging itself,
“growing by that it feeds on.” From these peculiar habits of mind,
namely, absorption in its objects, and for the most part in single objects,
guided by a simple love of the truth, there arises further, great
simplicity in the feelings with which the truth is contemplated when
it is discovered. There is nothing of a feeling of arrogance in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
great mind&mdash;a feeling that it has established a separate domain, about
which it alone is competent to legislate, and which none but itself
may touch or enter. Nor is there any thing like envy in such a
mind. On the contrary, he is ready to welcome with the hand and
the heart of a brother, and with warm gratitude, any who shall make
new revelations of that which he most loves and adores. Nor has
he any such love of system as would lead him knowingly to overlook
any one truth. Still less is there a feeling of triumph after discussion,
except as the triumphs of truth are his own. Least of all is there
a feeling of pedantry, the self satisfied glee with which little minds
chuckle over their small apartment in the world of mind, ready to
give battle to any one who shall dispute that it is a magnificent temple.
The feelings of a great mind are as different from these as
possible. His is the simplicity of reverence. He gazes upon some
truth, till it rises before him in its full dimensions, and to it he pays
humble adoration. Inspired by this feeling he forgets himself, and
comes forth with simplicity to deliver his message to others, seeking
not their praise, and caring not for their censure. He needs not, and
does not comprehend the arts which others use to attract applause,
for he can afford to be simple.</p>

<p>His again is the simplicity of wonder. “<i>Nil admirari</i>” is a maxim
of none but common minds, who can contrive to wrap themselves
up in self-sufficiency of intellect, while they trust in it and
laugh at the absurdity and childishness of him who finds any thing at
which to wonder. Thus such an one will exultingly go forth in the
full pride of scientific attainment, esteeming all things as certain when
he has ascribed them to the laws of nature; not thinking of the
mysterious agency ever at work to maintain those laws. Such a
mind has no wonder, because it has no powers to carry it forward into
the mysterious and illimitable in the universe. Another feeling of
the great mind in view of great objects, is that of simple ignorance.
It has gone forth, and seen its own narrow limits, and then it pauses
and is humble, conscious how like a child it is. Such are some of
the features which a great mind exhibits, and such the results to
which it tends, the expression of which is marked by that simplicity
of which we have spoken.</p>

<p>The allotments of providence are as various as are our several
necessities. To one is granted wealth, to another talents, to a third
family; every man, however humble, finds himself the possessor of
some separate good the which has not been equally vouchsafed to
all, and in that particular good whatsoever it be is treasured his
individual sum of human happiness. It is a beautiful thing that this
is so, for hence a greater degree of comfort among men, as each is
pleased with his own; and to a thinking man it is fraught with
deep and powerful truths, that tell greatly both upon the understanding
and the heart. In it is seen the kind plan of an ever present,
ever watchful Deity, studious for our comforts; and the mind
is at once fired with a nobler energy, and the heart is quickened with
newer faith to works of obedience, and taught to look with renewed
confidence and an unclouded eye through sorrows here, and rest on
that star of hope beyond the grave.</p>

<p>Among the blessings of providence, there is none which exceeds
the rich love of a sister. He who has been blessed with such,
whether he knows it or not, has ever had near him a fountain of
sweet thoughts and gentle sympathies, that could have made the
darkest day cheerful. Especially has he been blessed, if circumstances
have contrived to break him from all other ties of consanguinity,
and in joys and sorrows he has witnessed the development
of those beautiful principles which enter so largely into the composition
of her character, for the development of those principles must
have been attended by such love and considerateness on her part,
as only served to make them more beautiful, and bring them nearer
the attributes of angels.</p>

<p>A sister’s love is disinterested, and therefore invaluable. No one
has ever doubted but that the female heart generally is richer in
feelings than a man’s; that among our sweetest consolations when
earthly ties are sundered, and ‘thick coming fancies’ crowd in upon
the brain till it is black with sadness, are placed those alleviations
which her tenderness and her solicitude can offer. But yet the love
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
of another than a sister, from the very grounds of such preference
and its means of perpetuity, cannot be other than a selfish and mixed
passion. It is far more the result of circumstances; these have
power to modify it, and they are eternally changing. With a sister
there is nothing of this; with her it is the involuntary promptings of
nature, and to call such a selfish or mixed passion, is to call truth
falsehood. There is no chilling calculation, no selfish wish for a reciprocate
sympathy, and a latent purpose within to be <i>ruled</i> by this
in the degree of her own affection. She never thinks to ask if
there is a chance of the better feelings of her heart’s running to waste;
nor can she lean to the side of an overweening prudence, and coolly
measure out her love in just proportion to the worth of him to whom
she gives it. No! she can do none of these;&mdash;on the contrary, the
most eminent instances of her warmest devotion are found, where
the recipients of it were the least worthy. Cases innumerous might
be cited, in which, against difficulties to daunt other than her, her
love has seemed to grow purer and more enduring, even as a green
and luxuriant vine seems to take newer beauty, as it clambers about
a scathed oak or melancholy ruin.</p>

<p>A sister’s love is pure, and therefore invaluable. No truth is
more obvious than this, that those who have been favored with the
sweet sympathies and affections of a sister, and educated in that unrestrained
intercourse so favorable to the development of domestic virtue,
possess a softness of character and purity of feeling, to which
other men are strangers. I know it has been objected to this, that
such a character is effeminate, and altogether unfitted for the sphere
to which men are called. Now were the charge of effeminacy admitted,
we have yet to learn that true fortitude is not equally the
property of gentle as well as rugged natures, and that the manifestation
of it in one person more than another, is not traceable altogether
to other and opposite causes. But we do not admit it; the characteristic
above referred to is not effeminate; it is too sacred not to
be a treasure, and it is too beautiful to be an error. It is a spirit
like His who stood upon the waves, passing over and stilling the angry
waters of human passion; a breath of spring sent upon the world
calling the moss and ivy to their high dwellings, and scattering
the flowers upon the slopes and in the vallies; a beam of sunshine
thrown down from a summer sky, casting into shade the roughness
of the landscape, and softening all into beauty. A character matured
under the circumstances referred to, need lose nothing of its
firmness by the process. On the contrary, the native energies of
the mind may expand with greater freedom (for many of those
things which usually retard it are removed) and it can ruffle its
wings with a wider sweep, and stoop for the quarry with a nobler
vision. As for the charge, that our capacities for misery are increased
in an increased ratio by that refinement of feeling which is induced
by feminine intercourse, we hardly think it worth the refutation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
The fact that that French fool, Rousseau, could start a question
which involves this, has not succeeded in raising it above contempt;
and we shall quit the subject therefore with the simple statement of
our own belief, viz.&mdash;that Heaven never endowed man with any superfluous
faculties, that at every successive stage of moral and mental
culture there is more than a proportionate increase of positive
happiness, and that it is only when every power of the mind is in
requisition and each taxed to its extreme capacity, that the mind
approaches its perfection.</p>

<p>A sister’s love is eternal, and therefore invaluable. Much ink
has been wasted on the subject, of the power of female affection&mdash;for
which subject we have the current phrases of ‘dying for love,’ ‘broken
hearts,’ ‘Cupid’s achievements,’ and other such classical appellatives.
Poets have worn the matter thread-bare, and novelists have picked
up the shreds to patch garments for their heroes. One gentleman
less scrupulous than another, has dared raise a doubt of the
matter, somewhat withholding from the ladies the exclusive privilege
of dying thus heroically; another conceiving this a challenge to his
gallantry, has most manfully seized the crab-stick and fallen to work
pell-mell on the other side. Now amid such a clash of fire arms as
this we suppose it behoves us to walk circumspectly, and somewhat
question whether the fair bevy of our acquaintance would not cry us
heretic, did <i>we</i> call in question this same right, viz., of dying for
this or that thing just as suits them without asking leave of judge
or jury. But the truth of it is we have a belief on the matter, and
sorry are we to say that for lack of something better we feel called
upon to divulge it, deprecating however from our souls every intention
of making any unpleasant expositions, and professing a love
for the truth and nothing but the truth. To begin then;&mdash;we
boldly make the remark, that many a woman has gone to her grave
from ill-requited affection. The man who denies this, has either
never mingled in society, or has kept his eyes shut while there, or is
a fool. But&mdash;and here is the rub&mdash;whether the passion which resulted
in the breaking of this or that heart was an unmixed one, a
thing which of itself destroyed the heart, this I say ‘puzzles the will,’
and is a sad problem for solution. We make the following remarks:
any one who looks closely at society, and looks at the little springs
which operate on this side and on that to keep the whole machinery
in operation, will be wonderfully struck with the great discrepancy
betwixt real truths and those admitted as such by the world.
He will see that to trace an act to its cause, to find that principle and
trace it into generalities, is to frighten him at the artificiality of society
and the extreme ignorance of the human race. Effects which
he had been accustomed to assign to certain causes as things of
course, he finds are traceable altogether to other causes. The
strangest phenomena does he meet with; causes producing effects
as opposite to their apparent tendencies as possible; causes misnamed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
effects; effects taken for causes; in short, terms misapplied
and jumbled together with most admirable confusion. Now to apply
these remarks, we beg leave to add&mdash;that men <i>may</i> have made
a mistake in reference to the subject in question. For ourselves we
have known a case of misplaced affection&mdash;a lovely girl, fair as the
first star that peeps through the net-work of twilight, and gentle as
the bonniest May flower of the season. And yet she died; and
when the first burst of a generous indignation had passed off and
space was given for reflection, for the life of us we could not make
other conclusion, than that the <i>pity</i> of the world and her extreme
susceptibility to ridicule were enough of themselves to destroy her.
The truth of it is, it is one of the subtlest passions of our nature, yet
not the most powerful; and though it gain the same end, first subjecting
the other powers to itself and <i>thus</i> breaking down the spirit,
it does this rather by its extreme cunning than by any energies of
its own. But a sister’s deep faith, what alloy find we here! what
sentiment that the pure heart might not offer at the throne of God!
This is that star which brightens and brightens as it comes up from
the horizon and pours its undimmed beauty upon the world! It is
one of those flowers that sometimes spring up by the path-way of
life to tell us how bright was the primitive world, and give us a
glimpse of the brightness and profusion of the one to come! And
the eye brightens, the heart expands, and the soul bounds exultant
on its heavenward mission as we gaze upon it, till the veil seems rent
in twain, and we think and see and <i>feel</i> our certain immortality!</p>

<p>A circumstance fell under my observation not many years since in
a part of the state of New York, with which I shall close these remarks&mdash;indeed,
it forms not an inappropriate conclusion. It made a
great impression on me at the time, and the reader perhaps will
thank me for rescuing from oblivion one of those touching incidents
in real life which sometimes occur, and cast into shadow the wildest
dreams of fiction.</p>

<p>Any one who has visited the little town of P&mdash;&mdash; in Ulster
County, remembers well enough that there’s no way of entering it
from the west, save through a long defile cut as it would seem by art
through the heart of a mountain, and he also remembers what a
scene of beauty is presented as he emerges from the pass and sends
his gaze before him. A common of about half a mile square, surrounded
by neat and in some instances very elegant dwellings, in the
center of which with its neat bow windows and little spire, is the
only church of the village. The village has an air of life and business;
a stream tumbles off from the hills on the north supplying a
large factory on the lower grounds, and from the more elevated
parts may the eye catch the bends of the lordly Hudson in the distance,
and in clear still mornings may the ‘yo-heave-yo’ of sailors
or the clatter of steam boats be faintly heard, as they pass and
repass on the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>It was into this little village that I jogged with a quiet pace one
warm afternoon, and began to look around for an inn. It was the
heat of summer, and for no less than forty good English miles had
myself and horse stumped it since morning, and over as dusty a road
withall as one would like to travel on; and my horse seeming to feel
his necessities as well as myself began to move a little faster, and by
a sort of instinct, point his ears straight towards a large sign board
swinging directly over the road, on which was a rampant lion large
as life his fiery tongue lolling part way from his mouth, and a sort
of dare-devil threat in his eye that he was about to leap down on the
passengers. This however was yet a good half a mile off; and
as I passed along, the village church-yard lay upon the left. I had
come nearly to the end of this, when a light form sprang over the
wall, and running up to me seized my horse by the bridle, while it
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“O, sir, do come&mdash;they’ve left him all alone there, and I’ve
called to him and sung to him, and he wont hear me&mdash;do come, sir,
won’t you?”&mdash;and it pulled gently by the bit as it spake, and my
horse stopped.</p>

<p>I was thunder-struck. The creature before me was a faded girl,
and as I should think in the last stages of the consumption. She
must have been exceedingly beautiful once, for her form was still
symmetry itself, and her features were as regular as if shaped with a
chisel. Her face however was very pale. The blue veins were
traceable on a forehead of silver by the ridges they made, though almost
as white as the skin about them. Her eye-brows were regular
as if struck out with a compass, and beneath them her eyes
large, dark, and full, flashed as bright and as wild as stars in a wintry
night. Her lip was as thin as paper. Her dress lay loose and low,
and surely no lovelier neck and bosom (though they were shrunken)
ever came into a poet’s vision, than that which rose and sank there
painfully rapid as she stood waiting my answer. The hand which
still lay on my bridle-bit was so thin and attenuated, that actually
the sun shone through it almost as easily as if it were a piece of
glass; and her small feet and ankles which were without covering,
gave equal evidence of sorrow and abandonment. The only thing
about her which still retained all its former beauty, was her hair,
long, dark, and silky&mdash;that ornament of woman which death cannot
destroy&mdash;which she still possessed, and in thick masses of luxuriant
brown it hung about her with all the grace of a Madonna.</p>

<p>I know not but nature has given me an undue quantum of sensibility,
but I was melted to tears by this poor creature before me. I
have described her features&mdash;these the reader will see; but the
whole expression, the thing which cannot be conveyed to paper, that
must be imagined. Its wo, its extreme wo; the circumstances too,
so near a populous village, and yet alone; the church yard at hand,
and the few incoherent words dropped from her lips; these at first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
came over me with a sort of sickening fear, and I trembled lest the
figure before me should, like the witches that met Macbeth on the
heath, ‘change into the air.’</p>

<p>Just at that moment a dull dolt of a farmer came along the common,
cracking his whip and bellowing most lustily. Seeing me
stopped in the road, the girl by my bridle gently pulling it and eyeing
me with a beseeching look, he cried out, “Hillo, you Luce!
what the d&mdash;l are you at there with that gentleman’s bridle? out of
the way ye’&mdash;using a term I shall not repeat&mdash;‘and let me get by,
wont ye?” Seeing my cheek burning with an indignation that
tempted me to knock the rascal down, he said as he drove by and
in a much softer tone, “It’s only Luce Selden, the mad gal&mdash;don’t
mind her, sir.”</p>

<p>I turned towards her thus designated&mdash;poor creature! she had
sunk down at my horse’s feet like a young flower which the wind
has passed over too roughly, her long hair disheveled in rich masses
on the turf, and her hand grasping a few dead flowers she had
brought with her. Springing to the ground I lifted her delicate
form in my arms, and bearing her to a runnel of water which wimpled
near, I cast some of it upon her face and bosom. Slowly opening
her eyes she seemed at once to feel my kindness, and wreathing
her emaciated arms about my neck, her pent heart poured itself
forth into my bosom.</p>

<p>O never tell me of the equal distribution of happiness in this
world! Let the mad dreamer preach it if he list to those equally
mad, and for his own sad purposes; but let not man, immortal man,
man gifted with reason and obedient to the voice in every enlightened
one’s soul, herald such a monstrous absurdity! What had this
young and faded creature gained&mdash;what joy&mdash;what blessing&mdash;what
blissful moments had been hers&mdash;what bright dream had she dwelt
in&mdash;what fond hallucination had enrapt her young being in her
few brief days of infancy and childhood, that now just bursting into
the pride and prime of woman, such a cloud should come over
her fair sky, and with its folds, its thick folds, shut from her gaze
every star of hope forever! Dwelt she in a fairy-land&mdash;where
bright wings glanced hither and thither, touching and retouching its
soft airs&mdash;its mellow sunsets&mdash;its streams and golden fountains with a
newer beauty! and had her life like an unshadowed current in Eastern
fable, moved on in one unbroken flood of happiness! Had fancy
been hers&mdash;and imagination&mdash;and the dangerous gift of poesy&mdash;and
the faculty to shape out her own existence unmoved by the realities
of life&mdash;and her being been lifted up in high revel and communion
with the great and good of former days, and the far remote
treasures of purer existences! Had such blessings been hers! and
in return for them must the wick of the lamp thus early burn to its
socket&mdash;must society cast this flower from its bosom&mdash;must reason
lose her dwelling place&mdash;and her young life just opening upon her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
with its flowers, and feelings, and passionate thoughts, and innocent
gushes of tenderness, turn out a blank, a dead letter, and at one fell
blow be cut off&mdash;and she like a useless weed or wreck tossed up by
Ocean, be thrown out from her proper sphere&mdash;scorned&mdash;crushed&mdash;slandered&mdash;an
insulted yet still beautiful thing&mdash;a mark for the rabble’s
jeers, the clown’s coarse brutality, and the damning pity of
a mock-charity close-fisted world! <i>Let her unambitious story give
answer.</i></p>

<p>Luce Selden was a twin child. Her mother died in giving her
birth, leaving her and a beautiful boy to their remaining yet now
broken hearted father, and a victim to those sad crosses which motherless
children must meet with from the very nature of the case&mdash;though
that father was all in all to them, and though it was his pride
to watch over and nourish these beautiful blossoms of a love, as pure
as it was imperishable. He had married in New York, and came to
P&mdash;&mdash; while a young man and just starting in life, and by industry
and very fine talents had by the time he reached the meridian of life,
amassed a splendid fortune. His talents and wealth forced the meed
of praise from the rich, and his very uniform disinterested and noble
charities won the blessings of the poor, and fortune seemed to have
nothing to do but shower down her favors on his head.</p>

<p>But prosperity cannot always last. No! let the prosperous man
ever tremble at any long succession of blessings; for it is then that
sorrows are nearest, and those sorrows the worst and heaviest. If
it is not so in reality&mdash;if the reverses which we witness here and
there coming upon the rich and the fortunate&mdash;if they are not worse
than those which overtake other men, they are so at least to all intents
and purposes, for the hackneyed adage is a true one despise
it who may, ‘prosperity unfits us for adversity.’ The noble scorn
with which this or that man learns to look upon a run of ill luck, or
the heroism and devotedness of woman, may take a charm when
hallowed by the pen of Irving, but they are after all but as the creations
of the poet, mere creations having no parallel in real life.
That there is philosophy enough in the human soul even this side of
stoicism, to enable a man to look unmoved on the changes about him,
we do not doubt; but that the philosopher has yet risen who has discovered
the treasure, of this we do as unhesitatingly declare a disbelief.</p>

<p>If it is so, Mr. Charles Selden had never learned it, and it was
at the demise of his wife that he began to date the commencement
of his ill fortunes, which like rising waves seemed heavier
and heavier as the shattered bark was less and less able to endure
their fury. This was the first blow, the death of his wife&mdash;and
he bent beneath it. Yet his character seemed to have that elasticity,
that springiness in it which recovers itself again; and he once
more mingled with men, pursued his profession, and smiled with the
same cheerfulness. Yet there were times when his language seemed
too light, too rapid, too artificial, so to speak, for a perfectly happy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
man; and his friends sometimes whispered to their own hearts that
all was not as it should be, that there was something wrong within,
that that fine and delicate organization, his mind, did not act as
formerly; and they sometimes marked a kind of perverse vehemence,
which did not tally well with that uniform sound sense and
remarkable discrimination which had characterized the efforts of his
earlier years. Ah! they guessed well&mdash;there <i>was</i> something wrong.
There was a fountain in his heart which had been chilled, and which
kept bubbling up its cool waters to remind him continually of his
wretchedness; and there were moments, when withdrawn from business
and the world shut out, he gave himself up to that deadly
yet sweet sorrow which sooner or later saps the springs of existence.</p>

<p>Grief should never be alone. It is one of the most selfish of our
passions. The man of sorrows should be forced into the world&mdash;into
the bustle, and roar, and change, and activity of life, where against
himself outward and passing events shall catch his eye, and force
him off if but for a moment from his wretchedness. It will finally
loose the grasp of the disease, and thought by degrees may be turned
into other channels, and the heart beat with its accustomed excitation.</p>

<p>But even this did not save the bereaved husband. Perhaps it
might had no other ills assailed him; but he had become reckless&mdash;had
risked much&mdash;had entered largely into the excitements and
speculations of the day; and every thing working against him,
losses succeeding losses, the poor man sank under it and died&mdash;a
bankrupt.</p>

<p>But the saddest of my story is yet to come.</p>

<p>There are some men in this world from whom nature seems to
have withholden the commonest feelings of our race&mdash;men who
have no humanity about them&mdash;men who despise and disclaim every
thing like sympathy as troublesome and out of place, and who
would as lief dwell in a desert or on an island shut out from the
whole world, as any where else&mdash;save perhaps that they should not
have their fellow creatures to prey on. In short, your cool, calculating,
miserly souls, whose feelings all begin in self and end in self,
and who can like Judas or Shylock, coolly set off so much suffering
and so many ounces of human blood against so much money,
with the same callousness that they could barter dog’s flesh.</p>

<p>It was into the hands of such a wretch, a Mr. Saxelby, that these
orphan children fell now entering upon their twelfth year, and their
privations it may be relied on were proportionate to <i>his</i> wickedness.
The little that had been saved from the wreck of their once splendid
fortune he contrived to sink by one means and another, and by the
time they were sixteen it was formally announced that their means
were exhausted, and that master Lyle Selden and his sister&mdash;must
either work or starve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>It was like a thunder clap. The brother had hoped to study his
father’s profession; his talents were commanding, his industry unexampled,
and he had proudly looked forward to the moment when
he should redeem that father’s lost reputation, and lift his lovely, ah,
how lovely sister! into the station which her exceeding beauty seemed
so eminently to fit her for, and of which she would become such
a witching ornament.</p>

<p>This brother was a marked character. His person was manly,
his voice firm, and his countenance the index of a soul that showed
plain enough he was not born to be overlooked in the world. He
was sensitive and exceedingly proud, yet a nobler heart never knocked
against the ribs of mortality. But such a character as this is not
calculated to gain friends. He was too open&mdash;gave his opinions too
freely&mdash;and his talents were altogether too commanding and brilliant.
Your popular fellows are your middling ones. Lyle Selden was no
middling fellow&mdash;you would find it out by the first word that fell from
him though he were half asleep at the time, and though the subject
were as trite as those about which we witness the first volitation of your
incipient poetasters. He was an original&mdash;a marked man&mdash;and his
opinions though they might be sneered at, had nevertheless more
weight than half the school put together. As he was sensitive so
was he often unhappy, and though he met the taunts brought to his
ears by his few real friends, with ‘I care not,’ yet he <i>did</i> care&mdash;his
heart inly bled, and his lonely hours were often embittered. As he
was proud, this got him into difficulties; for though it was quite the
reverse of vanity and self was the last one he thought of, yet it
made his character a complex one which none understood unless he
chose to enlighten them, and this save to a few his pride would not
descend to. Hence he was thought callous and distant, when in reality
his heart was the seat of every gentler feeling; and to those
that <i>had</i> skill to look beneath the surface, he was linked by a friendship
as unyielding as it was noble. But these were few, and his
character is best told in one sentence,&mdash;<i>he was respected and disliked</i>.</p>

<p>His sister was an opposite character. She scarcely ever thought
for herself, and in person she was rather lovely than beautiful, and
had that touching feminineness about her which is rather to be felt
than told of. She was too gentle to be independent, one of those
rare specimens of loveliness that are shaped by associations, that can
be moulded into any thing by the energies of a master mind. In
short, she was too trusting, and had a spice of that credulous confidence
in her composition, which, if fortune does not try it sorely,
makes a woman a perfect nympholepsy and a vision.</p>

<p>Such were these orphan children, and in a world as we well know
not famous for its charities. It will be taxing my reader’s patience&mdash;who
is anxious I see to come to the end of my story&mdash;to trace
their lives minutely through the two or three following years. Their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
lot was a hard one. Thrown out of a station to which their birth entitled
them, the trials to which they were exposed had the same
effect on them as it does upon every body else under similar circumstances,
viz. made young Selden suspicious and fretful, soured his
temper, and took from him even the little amiableness which the
world had ever allowed was in his composition. While his sister, his
too gentle sister, like the vine round the tree which supports it and
moves with it as that is moved by the forest wind, so she changed
with her brother though winning still, for in her any thing like harshness
was softened down by a sweetness which nothing could destroy.</p>

<p>What I am now about to lay before the reader, is one of those
black passages in the catalogue of human suffering that may well
make me shudder as I write, and if the facts are doubted as here
laid down, my authority for them shall be given hereafter.</p>

<p>Lyle Selden, despised and trampled on by the world, neglected
and contemned by those that had abundant reasons for loving him,
opposed by fortune in every shape, and seeing that all his best and
most strenuous exertions to win his way availed not, but served only
to heap up greater difficulties, committed a forgery, and that too
under the signature of his guardian. That he was in a measure
justified in taking some means to gain back the fortune stolen from
him, may be admitted by all; but the law is not supposed to make
any distinction in favor of such circumstances, and its dread sentence
now hung over him, with nothing but the selfish griping hand
of Saxelby to stay the blow. The event was not yet public, and
here only was the last desperate hope of mercy.</p>

<p>The agony of Luce’s mind at this dread climax of suffering, must
be imagined, not written. Every means was thought of&mdash;every
compromise was proffered&mdash;every suggestion that a tender and delicate
girl almost maddened by the threatening evil could suggest,
was resorted to, but they availed not. The hard hand of Saxelby
could not yield&mdash;his ear could not catch the voice of mercy&mdash;his
heart responded not to any cry&mdash;he must have justice.</p>

<p>Luce was in the prisoner’s dungeon, and worn with watching and
grief and suffering, hung clinging to the neck of that brother who
had wept and toiled for her so many years. She saw that brother
broken down, the high purpose had flagged at last, the spirit had
quailed, the spring had broken, and the heart that had beat so true
and firm for her was now at her feet, and the storm had beaten it
nigh to its death. Was there no hope? Could she do nothing?
Was there nothing left for a brain on the brink of madness? No
dreadful, desperate, damning resort? Ah! there was&mdash;it smote her
like lightning&mdash;she lingered a moment&mdash;rose&mdash;clasped her brother&mdash;kissed
him&mdash;and with a wild look burst from the prison.</p>

<p>In a moment she was at the door of Saxelby, in the next at his
feet. There she poured out her soul&mdash;proffered him all&mdash;all that
woman values, life, soul, honor&mdash;<i>it was accepted</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>It broke her brother’s heart.</p>

<p>She became a maniac.</p>

<p>Such is a story of facts, and the half dead creature I held in my
arms was that same unfortunate sister. I conveyed her to the inn
of the village where I learned that she was a great trouble to the
place, and to one or two excellent families who treated her with every
affection. They were obliged to confine her. Yet she always baffled
them and resorted immediately to her brother’s grave, where
she would spend night and day sitting on the turf, and singing some
little ditty of former days. I learned also to my eternal indignation,
that save these two or three families, the village thought her little
better than a wanton&mdash;for Saxelby had died, and the facts were
known. Oh, cursed, and doubly cursed be this queasy prudery of
the world! Cursed be the spirit that casts out the repentant lost
one, who craves our forgiveness! Cursed be they who rant so noisily
of virtue, and prate of self-government! Tremble, and be merciful!&mdash;<i>ye
have not been tried</i>.</p>

<p>The story of this girl made an impression on me never to be forgotten,
and having so well as I was able made arrangement for her
future comforts, I left the village.</p>

<p>I afterwards passed through the place and learned that she was
dead. She had continued as formerly to spend her time at the
church yard, pulling the flowers from this or that mound to scatter
them over her brother, singing her little songs and talking half-reasonable
and half-wild to every chance passenger. Thus she
continued until late fall, when she was found one cold morning stiff
upon his grave&mdash;one arm bent beneath her and her lips softly apart,
as if the last words that passed them was her brother’s name.</p>

<p>On the cover of the Magazine is a picture of old Governor Yale,
with two lines of Latin poetry beneath it. These lines are part
of an inscription sent to the College at an early period by the Governor,
and are written beneath an engraving which now hangs in the
Trumbull Gallery. The engraving, we understand, was for many
years mislaid, and was at last discovered, so much injured that it
could scarcely be deciphered. The inscription is as follows:</p>

<p>We will bid farewell for the present to Spenser, for after all, the
intricacies of his stanza are least of all adapted to the mere translator.
We will now take the common ten syllable verse, and endeavor
to give as accurate a line-for-line and word-for-word translation, as is
consistent with the measure.</p>

<p>There is a difference in the translation of a part of the first two

<p>To what does this clause refer? We are rather inclined to give our
preference to the former reading, though after all it must be a question
of taste rather than of criticism. But have we succeeded the
better for confining ourself to fewer lines and to the easier stanza?
We think not. In particular, we have entirely omitted, in the second
stanza, all mention of <i>His</i> munificent designs upon the Western
shores; which in a son of Yale is indeed an unpardonable omission.
We will e’en go back to Spenser, and try our luck again under the
banner of this prince of versifiers.</p>

<p>This last translation has at least the merit of getting over the difficulty

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_INFLUENCE_OF_MORAL_FEELING_ON_THE_PLEASURES_OF">THE INFLUENCE OF MORAL FEELING ON THE PLEASURES OF
THE IMAGINATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">No. III.</p>

<p>The influence of moral feeling tends to heighten the pleasure
which we derive from beholding the works of nature.</p>

<p>“Our sight,” says Addison, “is the most perfect and most delightful
of all our senses. It fills the mind with the largest variety of ideas,
converses with its object at the greatest distance, and continues the
longest in action without being tired or satiated with its proper enjoyments.”
Hence those pleasures of the imagination which are perceived
through the medium of this sense, must necessarily be of a
high order. Besides, they have this advantage above their fellows,
that they are more obvious, and more easy to be acquired. We
have but to open our eyes, and the scene in all its beauty and power
enters. The colors paint themselves on the fancy, with scarcely a
single effort of thought, and each object in the view, as it catches
our glance, sends its appropriate impression to the mind, with an approach
as gentle, and almost as imperceptible as the dawn of the
morning.</p>

<p>This exhibition of nature is free to all. It is unfolded with equal
beauty and variety to the humble peasant, as he treads homeward
his weary way from the labors of the field, and the man of science
and taste who can enjoy it at his leisure. For each the same glorious
sun rises and sets, the same landscape of hill and valley and river
is spread out, the same rich colors glow, the same fragrance perfumes
the air.&mdash;In its full and ever changing variety, there is something
to suit the disposition and character of every one. The sons
of sorrow, whose only inheritance is melancholy and gloom, and in
whose minds the bright things of earth meet no response, may find
in the still sadness of the lonely vale, or in the steeps of the giant
hill, a spirit in unison with their own. And they, over whose fair
visions the cloud of disappointment has never flung its shade, whose
souls are radiant with the hope and gladness of life’s young morn,
may find their companions too in the joyous revels of nature. The
gentle whisperings of the summer breeze, the gay sparkle and the
rushing fall of the cascade, the mellow richness of the grove, the
gorgeous drapery of sunset, with these, with every thing that breathes
the spirit of joy, they can claim a kindred feeling.</p>

<p>The scene is ever before us in its unchanging beauty. It is not
like the bright shadows that charm us on in boyhood and youth, only
to vanish for ever from the sober realities of manhood. The breeze,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
that cooled the brow of the child in his early sports, plays with the
same freshness around the wrinkles of age&mdash;the meadows wear as
rich a green&mdash;the flowers bloom with equal loveliness&mdash;and nature,
still fair and attractive, as when the morning stars first sang together,
feels no decay from the lapse of years. What a barren and cheerless
waste would be presented to the eye of man, were all this world
of coloring to disappear with its ever varying distinctions of light and
shade&mdash;what a rich source of innocent gratification had been wanting,
if these had never been created. But</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and the confidence of the future is founded upon the promise that
seed time and harvest, summer and winter, shall never fail.</p>

<p>This power in the beauties of the natural world to excite and gratify
the imagination, is emphatically the poetry of nature, sending out
its appeal from every object which greets the eye. There is poetry
in the pathless wood, when the summer breeze sweeps over the
waves of its dark green foliage&mdash;in the bold scenery of the mountain’s
height, inspiring the soul with feelings of grandeur and sublimity&mdash;in
the green valley throwing a charm of hallowed tranquility
around the spirit. It dwells in the rising and the setting sun, in the
wild flowers of the forest, in the mighty winds, in the dark blue skies,
in the golden and silver clouds of heaven, in the rainbow, in the
seasons.</p>

on the vollied lightning, and uttering its voice of sublimity in
the deep-toned thunder.</p>

<p>In all these dwells the spirit of poetry, and it is the highest office of
the imagination, to extract from these the divine element. Is she
the less able to do this, when from nature’s works she looks up with
filial awe to nature’s God? By our admiration of the character and
attributes of the Great Creator, are we led to regard the works of
his hand, with emotions less enthusiastic and poetical? Strike out
of our minds, when contemplating the features of the natural world,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
those ideas of system, order, and adaptation to wise and beneficent
purposes so clearly expressed by them all&mdash;bid us ascribe all this
glorious mechanism, so exquisitely formed and so skillfully arranged,
to the unguided instinct of blind chance&mdash;and the tie that bound us
in such an endearing relation to the scenes of earth, and sanctioned
the communion of our better feelings with their ever eloquent spirit,
is sundered for ever. There is a religion in every thing around us&mdash;and
the spirit of poetry, that spirit which carries home to the imagination
the pleasures of uncorrupted taste, is almost one and the same
with the former. It is a religion which the creeds of men have never
perverted, or their superstitions overshadowed. It is fresh from
the hands of the Author, and is ever reminding us, with its still small
voice, of the Great Spirit, whose presence pervades and quickens it.
It glows from every star that sparkles in the far concave. It is
among the hills and the vallies of the earth, where the desert mountain-top
rears his snow-crowned summit into the frosts of an eternal
winter, or the lowly dell slumbers in the quiet of a summer’s sun.
It is this, uttering its appeal from the unbreathing things of nature
with an ever faithful voice, that fills the spirit with lofty aspirings,
until it struggles to cast off the chains which this earthly has thrown
around her giant, though infant energies, and soar away beyond the
influence of the cold sluggish atmosphere of sense&mdash;to attain something
etherial and thrilling&mdash;something which shall satisfy her large
desires, and open to the imagination a world of spiritual beauty and
holiness.</p>

<p>And he, who reads the volume of nature’s works, a stranger to
this blessed influence, does not read aright. He is blind to that peculiar
grace and loveliness which characterize them as a part of the
great system of universal order and harmony. It is to the imagination,
chastened and elevated by moral feeling alone, that nature
makes her choicest revelations. Indeed it is a libel upon the Author
of the human mind to suppose that He has endowed it with
powers that are to receive their most exquisite gratification without
the pale of virtue. We are of those, who believe that the intellect
of man is to receive its highest and noblest, as well as purest energies,
in its nearest moral conformity to the first, infinite and eternal Intellect.
And if the character of this creating Mind is impressed on the
visible creation, he who sees the most excellence in the former will
feel the strongest love for the latter. Those aspects of nature, which
to the unsanctified taste are without form or comeliness, are to him
invested with a most religious charm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_COFFEE_CLUB">THE COFFEE CLUB.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">No. III</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At last he is as welcome as a storm; he that is abroad shelters himself from it,
and he that is at home shuts the door. If he intrudes himself yet, some with their
jeering tongues give him many a gird, but his brazen impudence feels nothing;
and let him be armed on free-scot with the pot and the pipe, he will give them
leave to shoot their flouts at him till they be weary.”</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Fuller’s Profane State.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>Summer, with its transforming influence upon all things natural
and artificial, has come, and the Coffee Club feels somewhat of its
power. We introduced you, reader, to our room in the depth of
winter, we welcomed you with a blazing hearth and the cheerful
light of an astral, and our mystic tripod lustily bore witness to the
strife of the hostile elements. But now the aspect of the room and
the temper of its occupants is changed. A solitary taper with <i>all</i>
its light, can scarce effect a dim obscure&mdash;the thick warm carpet is
superseded by a flimsier texture of straw&mdash;the point of concentration
is transferred from the glowing fire to the open window&mdash;the center-table
is drawn back and relieved from its superincumbent load, that
the eye may not be oppressed with a sense of heaviness&mdash;in every
chair you find a lazy pillow, and even the sofa which would once
contain all four, will scarce suffice for the extended length of Apple
Dumpling&mdash;our coffee simmers over the sickly flame of a spirit
lamp, and is quaffed in cooler draughts, and from comparatively tiny
cups.</p>

<p>The temper of its occupants is likewise changed. That equable
hilarity which seldom rose to jollity and <i>never</i> sank below cheerfulness,
is gone; and its place is ill supplied by a fitful state of noisy
mirth and moody silence. Tristo is alternately more melancholy
and less so&mdash;Nescio, more entirely sensual, or more acutely intellectual,
as the whim seizes him&mdash;Pulito is absorbed in attention to
earthly nymphs one week, and shuts himself up in his room with the
heaven-born muses the next&mdash;and Apple, who formerly, like some
auxiliary verbs, had but one <i>mood</i>, is now variable through the whole
paradigm. The disturbing influence of warm weather and bewitching
moonlight is also perceptible in the irregularity of our meetings.
But few, very few times have we been together this term, and then
we have employed ourselves in the most random conversation. Even
to-night we have but an unpromising prospect before us. Pulito and
Apple are not here, and Tristo and myself have hitherto kept our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
thoughts to ourselves with most unsocial chariness. But hark! Pulito’s
‘light fantastic toe’ is on the stairs, and he must say <i>something</i>
as he enters.</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Good evening, gentlemen. You certainly have the true
atrabilious aspect; ’twould spoil my face for a week to sit in close
proximity with two such melancholy phizes. With your leave,
therefore, Messieurs, I will take a cup, adjust my flowing locks, and
be off. What beautiful little acorn-goblets you have here, Nescio,
and then the delicacy of the beverage, so nicely adapted to the season.
You have a rare taste in these matters, Quod.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Ah! Pulito, you are always the same careless fellow,
and ’twere vain to hope for any thing else from you; but cannot you
sit down for one evening and have a long and sober talk. You
know some of us leave town soon, and we may not have another
opportunity.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Indeed, Tristo, I am sorry to disappoint you; but
<i>this</i> evening I have an engagement from which I really cannot get
excused; the rest of the term I am entirely at your service.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “I’ll wager any thing from a pin’s head to ‘this great
globe itself’ that there’s a lady in the case.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Weel, an there be, gude Maister Quod.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Why you remember your boastful resolution to eschew
all connection with any thing more substantial than ‘Fancy’s daughters
three,’ during the hot weather.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “And whether these be ‘Faith, Hope and Charity,’ or
‘Wine, Women and Coxcombry,’ depends very much upon the
<i>fancier</i>’s temperament.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “I am afraid, my dear Pulito, that your aspirations after
learning are becoming less ardent; and unless you are more earnest,
your poetic ambition will fain be contented with being laureate of
the Coffee Club.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “‘What is learning but a cloak-bag of books, cumbersome
for a gentleman to carry? and the muses fit to make wives for farmers’
sons?’ What Fuller, in his ‘degenerous gentleman’ says in
irony, I would adopt in sober earnest.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Well, I perceive we shall get nothing from you to-night,
so you may go. But first tell us if you have seen any thing of Apple.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Indeed, I have, and bring quite a message from him,
which, but for your suggestion, I should have forgotten. By my
troth, in my head, ‘<i>dies truditur die</i>,’&mdash;one idea thrusts out another.
But for the story&mdash;I met Apple walking most abstractedly with the
huge roll of his autobiography under his arm. When I asked him
what he was thinking about, he obstinately confined his information
to the mysterious remark that he was ‘<i>coming up</i>’ this evening. As
soon, however, as he discovered that I did not intend to be there, he
unfolded his whole purpose&mdash;under an express injunction of secrecy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
which I ought to keep, and which I will keep&mdash;though I will give
you an inkling of it, as it may afford you some sport. He will probably
appear particularly brilliant, and converse more like himself,
his peculiar self. Verb. sat sap. Make fun of him if you can, for
I owe him a grudge for a spiteful pun, which he made on a lady’s
name. However, my masters, after I have given my neck-kerchief
the blameless tie, and curled my hair with the twist extatic, I will
leave you to your dull coffee, and bask me in the warmth of thy
sunny eyes, oh beautiful *&mdash;&mdash; *&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p id="PULITO_EXITS">Here Pulito made his exit, singing “di tutti palpiti,” with an air
of Cox-comical affectation, half assumed, half natural.
</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “A handsome fellow, and a bright. But the day will come
when a strong mind, and a well-stored memory, will be worth more
than the vanished rapture of a woman’s smile. What a pity youth
can never temper pleasure with&mdash;&mdash;, hist! that stumbling step
sounds like Apple’s.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “’Tis his,&mdash;let’s slip into the bed-room and see what
Dumpling will do.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Agreed; I promise myself materiel for laughter.”</p>

<p>[Enter <i>Apple</i>, with a look of pleased importance, and a mouth apparently
ready to discharge a witticism.] “Ha! Pulito! Tristo!
Quod! What, not a soul here but myself, who am <i>solus</i>, he! he!
pretty good! I’ll lay that by, and use it when they come. What an
ass that Tristo must be, never to laugh at my puns. However, he
cannot help himself to-night. I have various good things, aside
from puns. If the conversation turns upon wit, I shall say, ‘A witty
sentence should be like a scorpion, the sting in the tail, but should
not, like a scorpion, sting itself to death!’ If Tristo goes to rating
me for smoking, I shall say, ‘A cigar is the <i>summum bonum</i>, pity its
<i>fumes</i> are not <i>per</i>fumes!’ If Nescio says, ‘I am your host’&mdash;‘Yes,’
quoth I, ‘and in yourself an <i>host</i>.’ That stone will kill two birds;
it is at once a pun and a compliment. Ah me! what is the literary
world coming to? They all seem bent upon being dull, and the
greatest of scriptorial (scriptural?) sins is to say a witty thing. Volumes
of poetry and philosophy and oratory and the like come forth,
and never a bit of fun in ’em all. Now in my view even a sermon
would be vastly better, if the preacher, especially in the application,
would discharge at the hearer a few judicious puns of a devotional
<i>cast</i>. Bless me! where&mdash;where&mdash;confusion worse confounded!
where are my cigars? I can never shine without them. I should
be like Sampson shorn of his locks. I shall have to go by a dozen
colleges to &mdash;&mdash;’s to get some. Well! ‘<i>leve fit, quod bene fertur</i>,’
‘that’s a light fit, which is well borne.’ Ha, ha, good! remember
that.”</p>

<p>As Apple leaves the room, Quod and Tristo, bursting with laughter,
issue from their <i>latebræ</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Bravo, Dumpling, bravo.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Capital! capital! What if we appear to have just
come in when he returns, and give him a chance to be witty&mdash;ha,
ha!”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Constat&mdash;it is a covenant. But here he comes.”</p>

<p>[Enter Apple, puffing with haste, a bunch of cigars in his hand,
and a lighted one in his mouth.]</p>

<p><i>Apple</i>, (amazed.) “What! you here.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo</i> and <i>Quod</i>. “Yes, we’ve just stept in. You, I suppose,
didn’t think there was a soul here.”</p>

<p><i>Apple</i>, (chuckling.) “No, faith: I expected to be <i>solus</i>, myself!”</p>

<p><i>Quod.</i> “Why, Dumpling, you are witty to-night.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “A witty sentence should be like a scorpion, the sting in
the tail, but should not, like a scorpion, sting itself to death, ha! ha!”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Excellent! but do, dear Apple, fling away your vile
cigars.”</p>

<p><i>Apple</i>, (winking.) “A cigar, my dear fellow, is the <i>summum bonum</i>&mdash;pity
its <i>fumes</i> are not <i>per</i>fumes.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Your wit should not hinder your politeness. I dislike
them, and I am your host.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Yes, and in yourself an <i>host</i>, ha! ha!”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Why, Apple, where on earth do you get so many good
things?”</p>

<p><i>Apple</i>, (vainly.) “Oh! I don’t know: I believe it comes natural&mdash;impromptus.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Impromptus! Ha! Ha! Why, Apple, we were in
the bed-room here, when you came in before, and heard you practising
on your impromptus!”</p>

<p><i>Apple</i>, (coloring with shame, vexation, and alarm.) “How&mdash;how&mdash;what,
you did, did you? Pretty good hoax, though, wasn’t
it? Don’t tell the fellows ’twas <i>your</i> hoax. But being Dumpling,
I’ve got the <i>dumps</i>, ha! ha! so I think I’ll go home and write on
my autobiography.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Do so, and don’t forget this chapter.”</p>

<p>(Exit Apple with a hang-dog air.)</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Incorrigible!”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Utterly! ha! ha! it’s worth a dozen comedies.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As if by a secret and common impulse, the laugh and jest ceased,
and both became silent. Nescio sat by one window, emitting from
a fragrant Havana languid and infrequent puffs. His varying countenance
expressed a train of thoughts as motley as his mind, where
the weighty and the sober were linked and mingled with the light and
the ludicrous, and feelings and reflections came trooping by, robed
in a livery of serio-comic strangeness. He was thinking of the mystic
links that bind together the seen and the unseen&mdash;of the glorious,
expansive, elastic mind&mdash;that ‘<i>sine fine fines</i>’&mdash;of the invisible
shadings of the mental into the passionate, and of the passionate into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
the corporeal&mdash;of the attenuated conduits that bear reciprocally between
the mind and body a gush of joy or a thrill of anguish. He
turned from the puzzling maze, and by no unnatural diversion, his
thoughts passed to some of the most wonderful emanations from this
mysterious source&mdash;the productions of the ‘world’s sole demigod’&mdash;Ariel
and Caliban and Puck&mdash;the sisters three, and Titania with her
faery train&mdash;and Falstaff, and the good king Malcolm, and the maddened
Lear&mdash;poor, shattered Hamlet, and Othello ‘the dusky
Moor,’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">&mdash;&mdash;“Whose hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the base Judæan, threw a pearl away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Richer than all his tribe.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then came up in re-awakened life the fond musings of his own early
boyhood, and he was pleased with the contemplation, all groundless
and fruitless as they were, for he smiled at his former folly, and
thought himself too wise to be again deceived.</p>

<p>They had crowded one after another upon ‘Fancy’s ardent eye,’
bright and incessant like waves from the sun; and as he thought of
their number and their futility, his mind was neither spent with
weariness, nor darkened by regret. His feelings were still as vigorous
and varied, as they were, before they went forth in quest of
happiness and returned without even an olive-branch, as an earnest
of security and peace. He had been thus vibrating between thought
and revery for perhaps an hour, when he started from his waking
dream, and remembered that he was not alone. Tristo was
sitting at the other window, with averted face and eyes gazing on
vacancy, while in his hand lay an open volume of the sensitive and
melancholy Cowper. Nescio, I grieve to say it, is not always felicitous
in his address. He lacks that quick tact, which may be denominated
an instinctive sense of present propriety. He felt a reaction
in himself, and wished to confirm the dominion of mirth in
his own breast, by awakening it in that of others. He laid his hand
on Tristo’s shoulder, and giving him a friendly shake, said “Wake
up, man, what are you dreaming of? Come, sing us a song, <i>pour
passer le temps</i>. Pray Heaven, no pretty girl has crossed your line
of vision. If so, be not thou cast down&mdash;I can give you a charm,
a very talisman to gain her, in the whiff of a cigar, <i>ut ait Apple</i>.
Sigh and flatter, sit up late o’ nights so as to appear pale&mdash;seem for
a time to prefer another, and then assure her that your heart is, was
and will be all, all her own. In that moment of delighted conviction
press hard&mdash;the fort is yours.” Tristo was too sad to be angry.
He merely replied while his lip quivered with emotion&mdash;“Nescio,
you know not how you wound me.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Indeed, indeed, I did not mean it, you <i>know</i> I <i>could</i>
not. But why should you be always so gloomy? It vexes me to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
see you thus. Why should you not smile more often and more
willingly?”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Do I not smile?”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “O such a smile! ’tis worse than tears&mdash;’tis like the
forced laugh in the play. ‘<i>Male qui mihi volunt, sic rideant.</i>’
But why should your thoughts be so dark amidst the glittering activity
of life?”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “And why should they not be <i>entirely</i> dark? The
breath of this vast world sounds in my ear as the up-going of one
deep and universal sigh, and can the thought be other than a thought
of pain. My grief is not for myself alone, though that were enough.
But where is the man who is happy at all? unless, indeed, it be the
happiness of <i>apathy</i>. Where is the man of open heart and aspiring
mind, whose plans succeed even in the outline, or if the outline be
realized, the filling up is not a mixture of care and vexings&mdash;and
failure and regret? When we have reached some fancied goal of
youthful promise, which shone to the far off eye like the battlements
of Heaven, does not widowed hope put on her weeds, and mourn
over her children, and refuse to be comforted because they are not?”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “With such views of human life, where do you find any
relief from your melancholy?”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “To what should a mind saddened by its own afflictions
look for consolation. The world of <i>realities</i>, as I have said, presents
but a gloomy and scarred waste. Ah! then the greatness of
the <i>poet’s</i> power and the dignity of his art are most manifest. Then,
that which in our grosser moods, we had deemed light, pretty, and
only fit to while away an hour, becomes <i>mighty</i>, and <i>almost</i> adorable.
For the wearied and broken spirit, which all the riches of
learning could not soothe, nor the gift of kingdoms elate, may by the
witchery of poetry be wrapt into a calm, satisfied enjoyment.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “I wonder not that an early father, in holy abhorrence,
called poesy, <i>vinum dæmonum</i>, the wine of fiends, if its influence be
such as you assert. For surely it supplies to the educated and refined,
the same refuge from corroding thought and disturbing conscience,
which the intoxicating cup offers to the sensual and brutish.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “It is so in some measure, but with this difference, which
will immediately rescue this ‘divina facultas’ from injurious reflections.
The inebriating draught, the actual ‘uvæ succus’ offers its
poor and transient relief to <i>all</i>. The unfortunate and the guilty,
those upon whom melancholy has settled like a mist from the
ground, causeless and undeserved, though unavoidable&mdash;and those
upon whom an outraged conscience inflicts its scourgings in righteous
retribution, may there seek and find oblivion. But only a pure
life, a cultivated mind, a <i>religious nature</i>, (let not the phrase breed
heresy,) can secure to one the healing influence of poetry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “The idea is a sublime one. But is it not merely a
beautiful <i>idea</i>? Can you bring forward any evidence to make it
manifest, or even any illustration to render it probable?”</p>

<p id="TRISTO_NOT_PULITO1"><i>Tristo.</i> “With ease. Indeed, were I to search far and wide
through the whole circle of English poetry, I could not find a more
pertinent illustration than in the passage which I have just been
reading, and on which my finger now rests.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “What is it? Read it.”</p>

<p id="TRISTO_NOT_PULITO2"><i>Tristo.</i> “Even its title is affecting. ‘On the receipt of my
mother’s picture.’ It must be familiar to you, yet I will read a few

<p>Suppose now the case of two individuals, of equal refinement, intellect,
and sensibility, (save that in one the edge of all these qualities
must have been blunted by moral defection) nay&mdash;that by making
the parallel closer, the contrast may be more obvious&mdash;suppose
them to be brothers. In early life they both were trained in the
path of moral rectitude, from which the one has never swerved, but
the other has been constantly making wider and wider deviations.
Place them now in the situation of the poet, and let them read these
lines. The image recalled, the object of their contemplation is the
same&mdash;their early associations are the same. But the effect is far
different. The conviction is present with one, that he has persevered
in that course, which his mother toiled and wept to place him
in, and in pleased sadness he will repeat with Cowper,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Thyself removed, thy power to soothe me left.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The other is melancholy, but his is the melancholy of remorse.
Each vivid recollection but ‘adds hot instance to the gushing tear,’
and all that soothed his brother, but protracts <i>his</i> pain. He feels
in all its force the solemn truth, so quaintly expressed by the old
dramatist, Suckling:</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “You have quoted Byron, rather unfortunately for your
argument, I think, Tristo. For he is an instance of the existence
of high poetic power, in a mind depraved by the baseness of his
moral sentiments.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “You mistake my meaning, if you infer from it that I
think the <i>existence</i> of poetic power incompatible with moral degradation,
for there are many, too many instances of this kind. My
position was that a pure and unsophisticated character was essential
to the <i>enjoyment</i> of this faculty in one’s self, or as displayed by others.
And of this Byron is as strong a case as I could wish. Every
spark of genius, but assisted in lighting the flame, which scathed
and consumed his heart. ’Twas so with Shelly, and in the later
years of his life, with Burns. Moore is the only similar author who
approaches to an exception to this rule. But how widely different
with the opposite class of poets. Can you read a page of Cowper,
or Wordsworth, without feeling that they derive pure and exquisite
pleasure from their inspiration. Indeed to the former it was almost
his <i>only</i> source of enjoyment&mdash;without it he would have been wretched,
in truth, for his nature was too sensitive for a rough and jostling
world.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “I cannot deny it. You have, however, a higher idea
of the value and interest and influence of poetry than is current now-a-days.
I myself have been disposed to regard the high pretensions
of this ‘divina gens’ with something of distrust. I have dipped into
our poetic literature as extensively, probably, as most of my age; I
have been pleased and profited, but never have I been blessed with
an admission into the <i>penetralia</i>. My most diligent search (as
Pausanias records of the petitioner at Pion’s tomb) has been rewarded
by <i>smoke</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “I know that to the unreflecting crowd the life and labors
of the poet seem poor and paltry. He is one by himself&mdash;a
flower-gathering, shade-loving idler in a garden, where others are
busily plying the mattock and the spade. To them he appears engaged
neither in lessening the evils, nor in adding to the blessings of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
life. His musings they deem like the dreams of the sleeper, where
fancy, and vanity, and passion, draw scenes of glory and of pleasure
with the bold tracery of an unfettered hand; but to the waking eye
in the light of reason, those pictures are changed to the ungraceful
lines, and uncolored objects of ordinary life.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “I am by no means satisfied that their view is not a correct
one. It seems to me that the allurements of poetry and the
splendors of romance are all lymphatic draughts to inebriate the
mind, and, as ‘the subtle blood of the grape,’ exalts and quickens
the animal spirits, only thereafter to retard and depress, so do
these unearthly potations elevate the soul, but leave it dull, drooping
and disgusted. Especially pernicious in their influence are the
trashy productions of ephemeral minds, which ‘dream false dreams
and see lying visions,’ which clothe the children of their fancy in
perfections to which man is a stranger, and fill the untaught soul
with hopes and aspirations, which earth can never realize. Byron
certainly, and, I think, even Shakspeare, exert an evil influence in
their portraitures of character. Their actors are so sublime, or so
lovely, that they first inspire the mind with false hope, and then fill
it with vain despair.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “You speak the language of a half philosopher, who generalizes
a few isolated facts into an all-embracing theory. Even
Byron’s evil influence results not from the unnatural beauty of his
characters and scenery, but rather from the fact that he does not
seem to conceive of virtue even in the abstract; he no where shows
regard for aught but self, and no where recognizes even by accident
a standard of right and wrong. As for Shakspeare, nature is visible
in all his writings; virtue and vice are strangely mingled, even as
among the scenes and occurrences of life. If he ever deviates from
the actual and the known, it is either in the delineation of some
creature of professedly ideal existence, such as Ariel and Puck; or
else in the combination of circumstances which produces characters,
that all will allow to be natural, though such they have never seen
in actual life and motion.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Suffer me for a moment to interrupt you, and ask what
is <i>nature</i>? Shakspeare is certainly more natural than most of his
successors, and yet, for the life of me I cannot point out the difference,
where it is, or in what it consists. For the incidents of that
great master are sometimes not merely improbable, but impossible.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “The difference is this, Shakspeare brings together improbable
occurrences in almost impossible conjunctions; yet he <i>always</i>
makes the <i>words</i> and <i>actions</i> of his characters consistent.
Other dramatists have their plots sufficiently probable, and their
junctures and transitions natural and easy&mdash;this is the effect of study;
but their actors have no individuality&mdash;and this is a defect of genius,
that no study nor midnight watchings can supply: their figures are
sometimes one thing, sometimes another: the <i>contour</i>, air, and attitude,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
are all shifting and various. This is more particularly observable
in works of the tragic or semi-tragic cast, than in the comic
productions of the older writers. In Dryden, for instance, the comedies
are many of them laughable and good; but the tragedies, saving
here and there a splendid spangle, are cold, inflated fustian.
Even in scenes of the most intense excitement, when grief is wrought
up to agony, and passion foams with ungovernable rage, he makes
his characters talk, talk, talk, instead of acting. In place of some
brief and stormy exclamation, such as nature prompts and passion
utters, they stand still, gesticulate by rule, and bring out long similitudes
of studied elegance, and elaborate perfection. Their ruined
hopes they liken to a blighted tree, and coolly pursue the track of
the lightning from the topmost leaf to the downmost root, showing
you how <i>here</i> it grazed, and <i>there</i> cut to the very heart. Oh agony!
Their words are hot&mdash;hot enough in all conscience, when taken
one by one&mdash;<i>minutatim</i>&mdash;but collectively they are verbiage, not
pathos.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “I have been thinking that a natural may be distinguished
from an unnatural author, in that you can not only clearly conceive,
but distinctly remember the form and bearing of the characters
in the one, while the actors in the other leave no definite impression.
The Falstaff of Shakspeare, and the Arbaces of Bulwer,
are good illustrations of my meaning. Both are characters, which,
we are certain, never <i>did</i> exist. How, then, is Falstaff natural, and
Arbaces the reverse? The former <i>might</i> exist; the latter <i>never
could</i> have being. The <i>former</i> is a collection of qualities, carried,
it may be, to excess; the <i>latter</i> is a union of contradictions. The
<i>former</i> is witty and sensual and boastful beyond reality, but not beyond
possibility; the <i>latter</i> is a lumbering conception of a grand
and gloomy <i>something</i>&mdash;a shadow of magnificent shapelessness&mdash;it
has no <i>identity</i>, and its shifting outline it would puzzle Proteus to
trace. In the language of the schools, Falstaff is in <i>posse</i>, but not
in <i>esse</i>&mdash;while Arbaces is neither in <i>esse</i>, nor <i>posse</i>, nor any where
else save in Bulwer’s head.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “I believe you are right. But I was about to state why
poetry is a valuable&mdash;aye, an <i>in</i>-valuable gift. Now, observe&mdash;I
mean, not rhyme, ‘the drowsy tintinnabulum of song’&mdash;nor the display
of those poetical words, which, like trite coins, have no image
nor superscription left&mdash;nor yet, ‘in linked sweetness long-drawn
out,’ those brilliant figures, which have come down unimpaired from
Homer, and serve to conceal the deficiency of sense&mdash;but I mean
the pure ‘poetry of the heart’&mdash;the rich essence of feeling and of
thought&mdash;whether its expression be prose or verse, ‘oratio soluta,’
vel ‘constricta.’ It is true, without exception, that the purer and
less hackneyed are the feelings, the richer and more gushing is this
‘poetry of the heart.’ And this proves its excellence. To the eye
and the ear of childhood, the ‘visible face of nature,’ the green beneath,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
and the ‘skyey blue’ above, with the thousand voices, that
come quivering from the forest-depths, are all one vast <i>poem</i>, modulated
to a measure of dulcet melody, and awakening sympathies inexplicably
sweet. Thought to them is a rambling revery, and existence
is a thrilling dream. As they lie upon the green grass, and
view the sky, and gaze, and gaze upon the unutterable depths, the
yearnings for something beyond, beyond, <i>beyond</i>, are quick, and
strange, and powerful within them. As they grow old, and hardened,
and thankless, and wicked, does not poetry vanish, and fancy
flee? Are not the dreams of purity, and kindness, and affection,
which were but the strugglings of the youthful spirit to attain the
blessedness it was made for, supplanted by hard plans, and cold calculations
of wealth, and luxury, and restlessness, and pride? Hope
and Love, the birds of Paradise, that nestled in the boyish heart,
and fluttered with many-colored wings over their warm progeny of
kindling wishes, and bright resolves, are banished from their early
home, and in their place, with gloomy pinions, settle a thousand cormorant
birds, with the vultures of remorseless Ambition, and Greediness
for <i>more</i>. Who does not feel that it is only in his holier and
nobler hours that poesy creeps through him like a spirit, and
thoughts of grandeur cause his flesh to quiver, even as the forest is
shaken by the footsteps of the wind? Can one, who has but now
stained his soul with knavery or meanness, read that unparalleled monologue
of Hamlet, and surrender his heart to the greatness of its
power? Can any, save he whose spirit is daily and deeply filled
with the sublimity of rectitude, appreciate Milton’s sonnet upon his
blindness, a specimen of moral grandeur in thought and purpose,
which has found no equal in the walks of mind? I say not that
even in the bosoms of the vicious and the hardened, the perusal of
sublime or lovely conceptions will fail to produce emotion&mdash;deep,
strong emotion&mdash;for, wound and abuse it as you may, there will still,
even at three-score years and ten, remain something of that ardent
pulse, which, in boyhood, burned at the sight of beauty, and bounded
at the voice of song. But poesy will no longer gush continually
upward from the fountains of his heart, like refreshing waters from a
perennial spring. And what a glorious thing must it be for a Pitt or
a Webster, when worn in the defense of Freedom, and weary with
the hopelessness of their toil, in the pages of Scott to bury for a time
the projects of ambition, and the chicanery of courts! When they
bow their own mighty intellects at the still mightier shrines of Milton
or of Shakspeare, is not theirs the sacred thrill of the eastern pilgrim,
when he falls and worships at the tomb of his fathers? Wo
be to him, who would lessen his hours of poetic enthusiasm; for
those hours are a backward vista to an earlier and better state. True
poetry is the basis of devotion; and devotion added to poetry is the
‘Pelion upon Ossa,’ by which mortals may climb once more to the
heaven from which they fell.”</p>

<p>(<i>Throb</i>&mdash;<i>throb</i>&mdash;<i>throb</i>&mdash;) Oh this marrow-piercing, jaw-torturing,
peace-destroying pain!&mdash;(<i>throb</i>&mdash;<i>throb</i>&mdash;<i>throb</i>&mdash;) Sure the rack
were a plaything, lunar-caustic a balsam, aqua-fortis the very essence
of pleasure, compared with this soul-and-body-distracting torment&mdash;this
anguish double-refined, this agony of agonies. “A little
patience, my dear sir,” interrupted a soothing voice. ‘Patience!’
exclaimed I, ‘talk of patience to a cubless bear, a dinnerless wolf,
an officeless demagogue&mdash;but not to me. Would you look for moderation
in a maniac? wisdom in an idiot? gentility in a clown?
Who expects patience of a man driven to distraction by the tooth-ache?&mdash;(<i>Throb</i>&mdash;<i>throb</i>&mdash;<i>throb</i>&mdash;)
Oh! that arrow-like pang&mdash;&mdash;the
most excruciating of all!&mdash;And I clapped my hands to my jaws,
and springing from my chair, shrieked in agony. “Let’s see your
tooth,” grumbled a rough unfeeling voice&mdash;and before me stood a
veteran Esculapian, with his lancet and forceps fearfully conspicuous.
‘On with your instrument, Doctor,’ exclaimed I, ‘and out with it,
though I die under the operation.’ My head was soon made stationary
between two brawny hands, and my jaws extended to their
widest angle; the knife had unbared the offending dental, and the
dreaded instrument was ready for its work&mdash;but suddenly the pain
subsided&mdash;my feelings changed&mdash;I looked on the ‘cold iron’ with
horror&mdash;‘No! I’ll not have it out now;’&mdash;and the man of forceps
left me.</p>

<p>Again felt I the pangs of a ‘jumping’ tooth-ache. Powders&mdash;drops&mdash;essential
oils&mdash;remedies of every genus and species were
tried in vain. Even red-hot iron was of no avail&mdash;the nerve was
fire-proof. Throwing myself into a rocking chair, with elbows on
my knees and hands on my jaws, I leaned over the fire in moody
anguish. “The mind,” say physicians, “exerts a sympathetic influence
upon the body.” ‘Perhaps then,’ thought I, ‘the disease
may not be wholly physical, after all;’&mdash;and I began to reflect that
suffering often apparently finds relief in association and sympathy.
The hard-featured mariner takes delight in tales of naval misery;
the veteran warrior, in descriptions of battles; the love-lorn maiden,
in ‘doleful tales of love and woe;’ the disappointed suitor in dark
maledictions and long-drawn vituperations, against all that bear the
name of woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>With this in mind, I glanced at my book-case for some treatise
adapted to my own circumstances. Nothing presented itself more
to the point than the ‘Works of Robert Burns.’ His ‘Address to
the Tooth-ache’ was soon before me. I read it from beginning to
end with profound attention. The difficult Scotticisms were explained
in the glossary. I sought the meaning of every word&mdash;I
entered fully into the spirit of the piece. How beautiful!</p>

<p>Never before had it appeared in half so favorable a light. Never
before was I so thoroughly convinced that to appreciate the beauties
of an author, we must enter into his feelings&mdash;possess his spirit.
This I could now do perfectly. And those brief stanzas&mdash;where
was there ever such genuine poetry as in them? Byron, in comparison,
was fustian; Milton bombast; Shakspeare a mere poetaster,
and Homer a sleepy-head&mdash;‘<i>quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus</i>.’</p>

<p>The effect was astonishing. Ere I had finished the fifth reading,
my sufferings were so much alleviated, that I could even recognize
my own countenance in a mirror&mdash;though still somewhat distorted.
After the tenth reading, however, the kindly influence ceased. In
vain did I persevere; the fifteenth perusal was accomplished; but
all to no purpose. The twang&mdash;twang&mdash;twang&mdash;and the gnawing,
wrenching, screwing sensation still continued. Again I leaned over
the fire in silent despair. I revolved in my mind the poem I had
just read&mdash;the sentiment&mdash;the meter&mdash;the rhyme. A thought
struck me. This eternal snap, snap, snap, said I to myself, is meter;
this perpetual recurrence of similar pains is rhyme; these momentary
cessations of agony are intervals of stanzas. Surely the
tooth-ache, thought I, is a poetical subject. Coleridge lay open on
my table. My eye rested on a scrap of rhythmical Latin.</p>

<p>The hint was sufficient. Ainsworth and the glossary soon enabled
me to metamorphose Burns’s Scotch into Monkish Latin. If the
meter appear sometimes lame, or the syntax barbarous, the blame be
on the torturing pulsations that guided the movement&mdash;on the disorganizing
twinges that convulsed my whole mental fabric.</p>

<p>Before I had finished the closing stanza, the pain entirely left
me&mdash;whether it was owing to the exorcizing qualities of the Latin,
the soothing influence of the verse, the defiance-breathing spirit of
the sentiment, or to the <i>length of time</i> requisite for the performance,
I am unable to decide. Suffice it to say, that if any one, in making
trial of the remedy himself, after translating ten English stanzas into
Latin rhyme, experiences no relief, let him take an hundred stanzas.
If after this performance the pain still continues, let the prescription
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
be a thousand stanzas; and unless the patient be an uncommonly
rapid, or an unpardonably careless versifier, we hesitate not to predict
that ere he has accomplished half his task, one of two things
will prove true&mdash;either the tooth-ache will have left him for ever, or
<i>he</i> will have bidden farewell to the tooth-ache, and, with it, to all
the pains, and sorrows, and sufferings of this ‘vale of tears.’</p>

broiled, and all the other synonymes of igniferous horror. Oh!
ye dark-skinned Ethiops, how I love you! Verily I am an amalgamationist.
“Ye are black, but comely as the tents of Kedar, as the

fierceness upon your sweating brows, till they were dusky as the
wings of night, yet are ye not misimproved thereby; for your impenetrable
nigritude, surmounted by your oily fleece&mdash;more precious

“Much every way.” The heat unnerves the body, the body depresses

<p>An essay “On the reason of animals not the reason of man,” is
accepted, and shall appear soon.</p>

<p>An essay “On the study of human nature in the works of the imagination,”
is under consideration.</p>

<p>Lines “to Miss W.” and a “Vision,” are declined.</p>

<p>“Washington,” and “Poetica Falsa,” both possess considerable
merit; but from press of matter, we are compelled respectfully to
decline them.</p>

<p>“The Weather,” and a “Review of the past, No. 1.” are inadmissible.</p>

<p>P.’s remonstrance is received. Upon reconsideration, we perceive
the impropriety of publishing the stanzas without the “Prolegomena;”
and the Prolegomena are too long for insertion. The inference
is obvious.</p>

<p>“On Death,” by D., in several respects is unsuitable for publication.</p>

<p>“On the death of an aged friend,” is received, and shall appear.
We would request, however, the liberty of making a few alterations.</p>

<p>An <i>apology</i> for establishing a Literary Magazine, in an institution
like Yale College, can hardly be deemed requisite by an enlightened
public; yet a statement of the objects which are proposed
in this Periodical, may not be out of place.</p>

<p>To foster a literary spirit, and to furnish a medium for its exercise;
to rescue from utter waste the many thoughts and musings of
a student’s leisure hours; and to afford some opportunity to train
ourselves for the strife and collision of mind which we must expect
in after life;&mdash;such, and similar motives have urged us to this undertaking.</p>

<p>So long as we confine ourselves to these simple objects, and do
not forget the modesty becoming our years and station, we confidently
hope for the approbation and support of all who wish well
to this institution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The work will be printed on fine paper and good type. Three
numbers to be issued every term, each containing about 40 pages,
8vo.</p>

<p><i>Conditions</i>&mdash;$2,00 per annum, if paid in advance, or 75 cents
at the commencement of each term.</p>

<p>Communications may be addressed through the Post Office, “To
the Editors of the Yale Literary Magazine.”</p>

They can be seen

<a href="#TRISTO_NOT_PULITO2">here</a>.
Earlier in the text, <a href="#PULITO_EXITS">here</a>,
Pulito exits and there is nowhere in the text where he returns.

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
